I have created an Machine Learning model from the below Kaggle dataset.
# Dataset- https://www.kaggle.com/amananandrai/clickbait-dataset
# Dataset Overview-
The data is collected from various news sites.The clickbait headlines are collected from sites such as ‘BuzzFeed’, ‘Upworthy’, ‘ViralNova’, ‘Thatscoop’, ‘Scoopwhoop’ and ‘ViralStories’.The relevant or non-clickbait headlines are collected from many trustworthy news sites such as ‘WikiNews’, ’New York Times’, ‘The Guardian’, and ‘The Hindu’.We can apply different classification algorithms to classify the data into clickbait and non-clickbait.
# Purpose-
